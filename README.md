# TracerLPMpy
 
TracerLPMpy is a bare-bones wrapper written in python for the TracerLPM C++ library (https://github.com/bcjurgens/TracerLPM) which can be used in place of the MS Excel GUI. All of the TracerLPM solver, tracer and associated functions are accessible, as can be seen in the list of function declarations in "TracerLPM_CPP_Library.py". An example file is included which demonstrates basic usage. More development is in the works.
